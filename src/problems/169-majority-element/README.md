# 169. Majority Element

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, *return the majority element.*

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Examples

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints

- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in **linear time and in O(1)** space?
