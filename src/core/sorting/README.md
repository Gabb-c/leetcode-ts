## Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in TypeScript. Each algorithm resides in its own subdirectory with a dedicated README file explaining its logic, complexity, and use cases.

### Included Algorithms

Here's a list of the currently implemented sorting algorithms:

* Bubble Sort - A simple sorting technique good for educational purposes but inefficient for large datasets.
* Insertion Sort - Sorts by inserting elements into their correct positions within a sorted sub-array. Efficient for small to medium-sized datasets.
* (Add entries for other implemented algorithms here)

### Understanding the Code

Each subdirectory contains the following:

* **index.ts:** The main implementation file for the specific sorting algorithm.
* **README.md:** A detailed explanation of the algorithm's logic, complexity, and use cases.

This project aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of various sorting algorithms in TypeScript. Feel free to explore the code and implement additional sorting techniques to expand the collection!
