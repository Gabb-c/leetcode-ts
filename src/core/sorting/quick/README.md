## Quick Sort Algorithm

Quick Sort is a highly efficient sorting technique based on the "divide and conquer" strategy.

### Algorithm Breakdown

Quick Sort works by recursively partitioning the input list into sub-arrays:

1. **Choose a Pivot:**
   - Select a pivot element from the list (often the first, last, or median element).

2. **Partitioning:**
   - Rearrange the list such that all elements less than the pivot are placed before it, and all elements greater than or equal to the pivot are placed after it.

3. **Recursive Calls:**
   - Recursively sort the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot (elements less than and greater than or equal to the pivot).

4. **Base Case:**
   - When a sub-array has only one element or is empty, it's considered sorted (no further action needed).

### Time Complexity

The average time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n log n), making it significantly faster than Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort for large datasets. However, the worst-case time complexity can be O(n^2), which occurs when the chosen pivot consistently leads to unbalanced partitions.

### Space Complexity

Quick Sort has a space complexity of O(log n) in the average case due to the recursive calls. In the worst case (unbalanced partitions), it can reach O(n) space complexity.

### Advantages

* **Highly efficient:** Quick Sort offers excellent average time complexity (O(n log n)) for large datasets.
* **In-place sorting:** It sorts the data within the original array, minimizing additional memory usage.

### Disadvantages

* **Worst-case scenario:** The O(n^2) worst-case time complexity can occur with specific pivot selections.
* **Recursive overhead:** The recursive nature of the algorithm can introduce some overhead compared to iterative sorting methods.

### Use Cases

Quick Sort is a popular choice for sorting large datasets due to its efficiency. It's widely used in various applications requiring fast sorting, such as databases and machine learning algorithms.

### Implementation Details

The `index.ts` file in this directory contains the TypeScript code for the Quick Sort algorithm. It includes functions for:

* Partitioning the list based on a chosen pivot.
* Recursively sorting the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.

This implementation utilizes a randomized pivot selection technique to improve the average performance and avoid the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion

Quick Sort is a powerful and efficient sorting algorithm. While it has a potential worst-case scenario, its average performance makes it a valuable tool for various sorting tasks in TypeScript projects.
